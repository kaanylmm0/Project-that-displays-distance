I made this project to show the distance value instantly on the LCD screen in the mobile application and processing interface application. 
Additionally, with the 3 different colored LEDs I used, our LEDs will turn red, yellow and green according to the changing distance values.

Materials I use:
1- HC-SR04
2-Arduino UNO
3- Breadboard
4-Bluetooth module (HC-05)
5-potentiometer
6-16X2 LCD screen
7- 3 diffrent color led(red-yellow,green)
8- jumper cable
9-resistance
